  <li>This release supports .NET Framework 4.5 (Production), where ever .NET Framework 4.0 is supported.<br/></li>

<h2><a name="Documentation"></a>INSTALLATION AND SETUP NOTES</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>&nbsp;Product Dependencies
            <br />
            <br />
            ODP.NET requires Oracle Client 11.2.0.3.0 or Oracle Instant Client 11.2.0.3.0. 
            When installing a new ODP.NET 11.2.0.3.0 instance, Oracle Universal Installer 
            (OUI) will automatically install Oracle Instant Client 11.2.0.3.0.<br /><br /></li>
        <li><b>&nbsp;</b>Policy DLLs
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that the installation of ODP.NET will place ODP.NET policy DLLS into the 
            GAC so that existing applications can start using the newly installed ODP.NET 
            version immediately. However, if this is not desired, be sure to remove the 
            policy DLLs from the GAC.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Registry Settings
            <br />
            <br />
            ODP.NET&#39;s registry settings are located under HKLM\Software\Oracle\ODP.NET\<version>. 
            Each version of ODP.NET uses its own set of settings under the version key. When 
            a new version of ODP.NET is installed, a new version key is created with a set 
            of default settings. The new key will not inherit any default or non-default 
            settings from the previous version of ODP.NET. Thus, reconfiguration is 
            necessary after the installation if default setting are not to be used.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Home Selector
            <br />
            <br />
            When the home selector is used to activate a specific Oracle Home, ODP.NET in 
            that Oracle Home will be reconfigured. However, policy DLLs for the newer 
            version of ODP.NET will not be removed from the GAC. Therefore, for the 
            application to use the version of ODP.NET that is installed in the selected 
            Oracle Home, some policy DLLs may need to be removed from the GAC or need to be 
            disabled via configuration files.<br>

    <h2><a name="Known_Issues"></a>BUG FIXES IN ODAC 11.2 RELEASE 5 PRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>The ODP.NET binaries in this ODAC 11.2 Release 5 Production is based off of the 
        RDBMS 11.2.0.3.0 Release Patch 10. This release includes the following bug 
        fix in addition to those fixes in ODP.NET that was shipped with the RDBMS 
        11.2.0.3.0 Release Patch 10: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>CUSTOM MAPPING IS NOT RESET TO DEFAULTS FOR THE GIVEN VISUAL STUDIO PROCESS WHEN PROJECT IS CLOSED.
          NOTE: to workaround this issue, one can simply relaunch Visual Studio. (Bug 14517263).<br/><br/></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>ENTITY FRAMEWORK RELATED TIPS, LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
    </span>
    <ol>
        <li>Interval Day to Second and Interval Year to Month column values cannot be 
            compared to literals in a WHERE clause of a LINQ to Entities or an Entity SQL 
            query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>LINQ to Entities and Entity SQL (ESQL) queries that require the usage of SQL 
            APPLY in the generated queries will cause SQL syntax error(s) if the Oracle 
            Database being used does not support APPLY. In such cases, the inner exception 
            message will indicate that APPLY is not supported by the database.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>ODP.NET does not currently support wildcards that accept character ranges for 
            the LIKE operator in Entity SQL (i.e. [] and [^]). [Bug 11683837]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>ODP.NET 11.2.0.3 does not support Code First nor the DbContext APIs.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>Executing LINQ or ESQL query against tables with one or more column names 
            that are close to or equal to the maximum length of identifiers (30 bytes) may 
            encounter &quot;ORA-00972: identifier is too long&quot; error, due to the usage of alias 
            identifier(s) in the generated SQL that exceed the limit.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got NCLOB&quot; error will be 
            encountered when trying to bind a string that is equal to or greater than 2,000 
            characters in length to an XMLType column or parameter. [Bug 12630958]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932 : inconsistent datatypes&quot; error can be encountered if a string of 
            2,000 or more characters, or a byte array with 4,000 bytes or more in length, is 
            bound in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query. The same error can be encountered 
            if an entity property that maps to a BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, LONG, LONG RAW, XMLTYPE 
            column is used in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>The provider manifest token is required to be two most-significant digits 
            of an Oracle database version number. For example, &quot;11.2&quot; would be the provider 
            manifest token for the Oracle 11gR2 database. The valid provider manifest token 
            will be properly generated in the model if ODP.NET 11.2.0.3.0 or higher is used.<br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>An &quot;Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow&quot; exception can be 
            encountered when fetching numeric values that have more precision than what the 
            .NET type can support. In such cases, the LINQ or ESQL query can &quot;cast&quot; the the 
            value to a particular .NET or EDM type to limit the precision and avoid the 
            exception. This approach can be useful if the LINQ/ESQL query has 
            computed/calculated columns which will store up to 38 precision in Oracle, which 
            cannot be represented as .NET decimal unless the value is casted. <br /><br /></li>
        <li>Oracle Database treats NULLs and empty strings the same. When executing string 
            related operations on NULLS or empty strings, the result will be NULL. When 
            comparing strings with NULLs, use the equals operator (i.e. &quot;x == NULL&quot;) in the 
            LINQ query, which will in turn use the &quot;IS NULL&quot; condition in the generated SQL 
            that will appropriately detect NULL-ness.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>If an exception message of &quot;The store provider factory type 
            &#39;Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory&#39; does not implement the 
            IServiceProvider interface.&quot; is encountered when executing an Entity Framework 
            application with ODP.NET, the machine.config requires and entry for ODP.NET 
            under the <DbProviderFactories> section. To resolve this issue by adding an 
            entry in the machine.config, reinstall ODAC. To avoid other issues, install it 
            into a new Oracle home.<br /><br /></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>TIPS, LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
    </span>
    <ol>
        <li><span>If SenderId is specified in OracleAQMessage object while enqueuing, the 
            sender id of dequeued message will have &quot;@ODP.NE&quot; appended in the end. [Bug 
            7315542]<br /><br /></span></li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00942: table or view does not exist&quot; error may be thrown from Dequeue or 
            DequeueArray method invocations when OracleAQDequeueOptions.DeliveryMode is 
            specified as OracleAQMessageDeliveryMode.Buffered and 
            OracleAQDequeueOptions.Correlation is specified and there are no messages 
            available in the queue. [Bug 7343633]<br /><br /></li>
        <li>If the Oracle Database version is 10.1 or earlier, 
            OracleAQMessageAvailableEventArgs.QueueName is not double quoted in regular 
            (i.e. non-group) notifications. [Bug 8253957]<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Application may not receive group notifications if GroupingInterval property on 
            the OracleNotificationRequest object is set to 0. [Bug 7373765]<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Against 9.2 database, a message remains in WAITING state if the Delay property 
            of OracleAQMessage was set to a non-zero value while enqueuing the message. [Bug 
            8828674]<br /><br /></li>
        <li>OracleConnection object&#39;s OpenWithNewPassword() method invocation will result in 
            an ORA-1017 error with pre-11.2.0.3.0 database versions. [Bug 12876992]<br /><br /></li>
        <li>When installing .NET related products for Windows x64 onto an ORACLE_HOME or 
            ORACLE_BASE on a mapped drive, a System.IO.FileLoadException exception may be 
            thrown by OraProvCfg.exe during installation. To work around this issue, install 
            .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 or later on the system where OUI install is being 
            executed. [Bug 10225338]<br/><br/></li>
